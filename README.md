# MCBES
####Based off Podrum by MFDGaming, Nougator
#### written by [![MFDGaming]](http://github.com/MFDGaming), nobody5050

#### MCBES is a powerful fast minecraft proxy server. built for minecraft pocket 0.6.1 and minecraft Pi edition 0.1.1

### Why python?
Python is fast, easy to write, easy for fix bugs. Note, Runs Python 3.4.

### Release date?
It is going to be released when it is done

### Why 0.6.1?
I anticipate being asked this a lot if I make it work so I might as well answer now. Basically this is a proxy that translates
packets send by minecraft pi edition over to ppackets by new bedrock edition servers, the goal being the ability to join
minecraft bedrock servers on on your pi. **This may constitute piracy as I am enabling you to play minecraft bedrock worlds
for free however I claim no responsibility to what you do with this software. please have a valid version of minecraft bedrock
when playing this**
