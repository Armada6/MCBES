# MCBES

#### MCBES is a powerful fast minecraft proxy server! 
Built using the same technology as [Podrum](http://github.com/podrum/podrum), it allows Minecraft for raspberry pi clients to join a server made for minecraft bedrock.


## FAQ:
### Why python?
Python is fast, easy to write, easy for fix bugs. 

### Why Minecraft for Raspberry pi?
Minecraft for raspberry pi or mcpi for short is a version of minecrsft that has not been updated in a long time; in fact it only got 2 updates in its entire lifespan. Despite this however it has a rich modding api built in that allows access to almost the entire game. 
Mcbes is an attempt to recify the one true flaw with it: it cant play with newer versions of the game. 

### How do I use it?
Clone the repository and run either *start.sh* or *start.bat*
It will guide you through installation and basic usage. 

Please note:
**The server cannot currently be joined**
